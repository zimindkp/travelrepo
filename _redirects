# _redirects file
# Place this file in your site's publish directory (e.g., 'public' or 'dist')

# Rule 1: Allow Netlify Identity and Git Gateway paths
# These paths MUST be accessible for Identity to work (login, signup, etc.)
# and for the Identity widget to function.
/.netlify/identity/* /.netlify/identity/:splat 200
/.netlify/git/* /.netlify/git/:splat 200

# Rule 2: Allow access to the login page itself
# If this page is protected by a general rule, you'll get an infinite loop!
/login.html /login.html 200

# Rule 3: Protect ALL other content and redirect to login if not logged in
# This rule should be generic and come *after* specific allow rules.
# If a user is NOT in the 'loggedIn' role, they are redirected to /login.html
/* /login.html 302! Role=!loggedIn
# The '!' in '!loggedIn' means "if the user does NOT have the 'loggedIn' role".
# The '302!' forces the redirect to happen even if a file at the target path exists.

# Optional: Rule 4: Grant access to specific content based on role
# Example: If you have a protected area /dashboard/* that only 'admin' can see.
# This rule should come BEFORE the general catch-all for unprotected content.
# /dashboard/* /dashboard/:splat 200! Role=admin

# Optional: Rule 5: Catch-all for protected content that isn't login/identity or special roles
# If a user IS logged in but doesn't have a specific role for a page, you might
# want to redirect them to a different "access denied" page or back to home.
# This rule is often not strictly necessary if Rule 3 is sufficient.
# /* /index.html 200 # If they are loggedIn, just let them see content
